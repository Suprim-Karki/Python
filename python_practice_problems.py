'''
Conditions, Loops, and Basic String Manipulation
'''

'''1. Check if a Number is Prime
Write a program that takes a number from the user and checks if it is a prime number. If the
number is prime, print ”The number is prime”; otherwise, print ”The number is not prime.”'''

# n=int(input("Enter a number\n"))
# c=0
# for i in range(1,n+1):
#     if n%i==0:
#         c+=1
# if c==2:
#     print("Prime")
# else:
#     print("Not prime")



'''2. Factorial Calculation Using a Loop
Ask the user to enter a positive integer and write a program to calculate its factorial using a
for loop. Display the result.'''

# n=int(input("Enter a number"))
# fact=1
# for i in range(1,n+1):
#     fact*=i
# print(fact)

'''3. Reverse a String
Write a program that asks the user for a string and then prints the reversed version of that
string. For example, if the input is ”Python,” the output should be ”nohtyP”.'''

# s=input("Enter a string")
# rev=""
# for i in range(len(s)-1,-1,-1):
#     rev+=s[i]
# print(rev)

'''4. Count Vowels in a String
Ask the user to enter a string and write a program to count the number of vowels (a, e, i, o,
u) in the string. Display the vowel count.'''

'''5. Multiplication Table
Write a program that takes a number from the user and prints its multiplication table up to
10. For example, if the user enters 5, the output should display the table of 5 from 5 x 1 to
5 x 10.'''

'''6. Sum of Digits of a Number
Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer and calculates the sum of its digits.
For example, if the input is 123, the output should be 6 (1 + 2 + 3).'''

'''7. Palindrome Checker
Ask the user for a word and write a program to check if it is a palindrome (reads the same
forward and backward). If it is a palindrome, print ”The word is a palindrome”; otherwise,
print ”The word is not a palindrome.”'''

'''8. Generate Fibonacci Sequence
Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer n and generates the first n numbers
in the Fibonacci sequence.'''

'''9. Find Minimum and Maximum in a List
Ask the user to enter a list of numbers. Write a program to find and print the smallest and
largest numbers in the list.'''

'''10. Word Frequency Counter
Write a program that takes a sentence from the user and counts the frequency of each word.
Display the results as a dictionary where each word is a key and its frequency is the value.
